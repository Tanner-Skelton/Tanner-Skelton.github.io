# csce464_midterm_project
Internet systems programming final project.

For the final project we implemented a lot of the stuff we learned the second half of the year. We added a register and login page that creates and stores user information in our database. These pages also ensure that an account exists and the correct credentials have been entered. 

A big part of this project was creating the database, making our connection, and correctly asving and loading values from it. The database create script is labeled "CSCE464FinalProj.sql." All of our database handling is done using php codes like we were taught in class. 

We also created a shopping page and shopping cart. Each user has their own shopping cart and can logout and still keep their cart. Though we do not collect any information for checkout (we didn't want to collect data like this for this project), there still is a checkout button to show that inventory numbers are still correctly manipulated.
